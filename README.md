*Ikigai-Based Mental Health & Productivity Correlator for Students*

Problem: Students’ mental health issues often go unnoticed until they reach critical stages such as burnout, anxiety, or academic failure. Existing solutions are either reactive, medicalized, or disconnected from students’ daily routines and productivity patterns.

Solution: This project proposes a web-based system that uses data science and machine learning to analyze students’ daily habits—including sleep patterns, study hours, screen time, physical activity, and self-reported mood—to predict stress levels and productivity.

🎯 Objectives 
1.. Identify early stress and burnout patterns in students 
2.. Encourage balanced routines using behavioral data 
3.. Translate the Ikigai philosophy into measurable indicators 
4.. Provide explainable, ethical, and preventive insights

By integrating the Ikigai framework (What you love, What you are good at, What the world needs, and What you can be paid for), 
the system visualizes balance between mental well-being and academic effort. 
The platform provides early stress indicators and personalized suggestions to help students maintain a healthy, sustainable routine before serious mental health issues occur.
Disclaimer: This system is not a medical diagnostic tool. It is intended for awareness, self-reflection, and preventive well-being support.
